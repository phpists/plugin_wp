Automatically insert post ads after paragraphs of your posts, pages, and custom post types.

== Description ==

= Ads Plugin With Auto Ad Injection =

Need an easy way to automatically insert post ads?

In-post ads get the best click through rate. If you want to increase your CTR and Google AdSense revenue, then you need to insert post ads within your content.

Insert Post Ads allows you to automatically insert post ads after a specified number of paragraphs. This saves you the hassle of manually inserting post ads for every post.

We created this plugin to make it as easy as possible to insert ads in posts.

= Insert Post Ads Features =

* Quick and easy setup
* Automatic <strong>Google AdSense injection</strong>
* Insert post ads using any third party advertising code, or custom code
* Select whether to insert post ads on posts, pages, or custom post types.
* Choose to insert post ads before content, after post content, or after specified number of paragraphs

Insert Post Ads makes monetizing your blog easy.

1. Install Insert Post Ads by uploading the `insert-post-ads` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Active the Insert Post Ads plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Add your adverts by navigating to the `Post Adverts` in the WordPress Administration menu.
4. Choose where to insert your newly created Post Adverts by navigating to `Post Adverts > Settings` in the WordPress Administration menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will my post ads be responsive? =

When you insert post ads, your theme will determine whether or not your post ads are responsive on mobile devices.

= Does Insert Post Ads work with custom post types? =

Yes, you can choose to insert post ads in custom post types in the `Post Adverts > Settings` menu.

= What about AMP pages? =

You can disable ads created using this plugin from being printed on your AMP pages by using the filter 'insert_post_ads_enabled' and setting it to boolean false.

== Notes ==

Insert Post Ads is the easiest ad injection plugin, for Google AdSense or any advertising code.

Our goal is to make using WordPress easy for beginners.

I feel that we have done that here. I hope you enjoy using Insert Post Ads.
